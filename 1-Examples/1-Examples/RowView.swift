        // and let the parent view decide what additional constraints and padding to add

        // This is all we need to layout the label as `UILabel`s have their own intrinsic content size
        // for height and width

        titleLabel.leadingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: leadingAnchor).isActive = true

        // Discussion:
        //
        // Notice how we didn't specifiy the gap between the label and swtich. That's perfectly OK.
        // We are designing this so that the label is pinned to the left, the switch to the right,
        // and the gap between them can flex and be calculted dynamically based on the size of the
        // device and screen.
